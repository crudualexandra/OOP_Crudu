The program executes the repartisation of the caracters into their universe, but there is an aspect of working in swift from xcode. The input json 
has to be included not in the map that we work from in xcode but in the Derived Data map of the xcode where also the otput jsons will be displayed.
On my computer I included the input json here:/Users/crudualexandra/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/OOPLab0-fmtwcdeprarbypaldfxncwggbdqv/Build/Products/Debug/
In the debug map from Derived data appear also the json files with every universe. So the problem is that you cannot see them displayed right in the work map when building the system.
I will include the output jsons into an map so you can see how the program sorted them. If any question I can explain and show how it works on the lab. lesson.
